        <li>I love biking everywhere. To the parks, the trail towards the farms in West Davis, and seeing the sheep and beautiful Davis sunset. - Demi</li>
        <li>I like to get floral or herbal drinks from some of the nice coffee shops in Davis. Temple has a really nice peppermint tea called Bliss. It's pretty calming and feels luxurious. And Mishka's has a rose latte, I think! - Anon</li>
        <li>Honestly, talking to the people at Dutch Bros really makes me happy. They're always so excited and friendly! - Violet</li>
        <li>Taking showers. Sounds easy, often isn't. Especially helpful during the hot Davis summers. - T</li>
        <li>I love going to see movies at The Varsity. It's normally emptier than most theaters, which is great for me and makes me much less nervous than full theaters do. - Anon</li>
        <li>Now that I have a car, one of my favorite things to do is drive back to West Village at night to the very edge, right before the fields, and just park there with the windows open. It smells so nice. Driving through campus at night is nice, too. Just be careful and safe! - Violet</li>
        <li>Go visit Taranbir at Rajaâ€™s to remind u everything will be okay - Jay</li>
        <li>The dog statues in the Greenbelt always make me happy. :) They're just so sweet! - Anon</li>
        <li>Sometimes, when I have enough time after class, I just walk home from school. I live about a mile away from campus, in North Davis, and it's a safe walk in the daytime. It's really nice in the spring, especially. - Anon</li>
        <li>I like going to the top balcony at the John Natsulas Gallery and lying on the soga and staring at the sky or people watching the streets below. - Demi</li>
        <li>I like to sit in the Arboretum and listen to people playing the outdoor piano by the Wyatt Pavilion. - Erica</li>
        <li>Go sit by the cows! - G</li>
