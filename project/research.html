    <h2>background research</h2>
    <p>I am interested in working on a customizable and personalizable self-care and mental illness symptom-reduction app. My research was focused on gamification and mental health.</p>
    <p>From “Gamification and Serious Games for Personalized Health,” I familiarized myself with existing vocabulary used to discuss things like the app I am interested in designing. The article defines “personalized health” as having a focus on the development of treatments tailored to the specific needs of a given patient (McCallum, 85). It notes how video games are connected to a desire for control, as they rely on the actions of a player (McCallum, 85). It connects these two concepts by stating that personalized health practices and games are both capable of “placing the individual in the center of the action” (McCallum, 85). The article’s author, Simon McCallum, references a taxonomy created by the Games for Health project, which breaks down different ways in which games might address health. “Preventative” and “Therapeutic” are the two categories most applicable to my interest, though “Informatics” could also be useful (McCallum, 86). McCallum defines a “serious game” as a game designed to “achieve some change in the player” (McCallum, 86). They define “gamification” as the implementation of video game elements or mechanics outside of the context of games, referencing user experience as the primary driving force in gamification as a design choice (McCallum, 87). Being able to properly categorize the kind of gamification self-care and treatment app I would like to develop should help me consider how it fits within existing standards and taxonomies, and what needs it could potentially meet that are not already being met.</p>
    <p>In “Serious Games and Gamification of Mental Health: Current Status and Promising Directions,” the various authors stated that serious games might increase the impact of “mental health internet interventions” by “extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them” and by improving user engagement with therapeutic resources through the employment of “game-based. . . motivational” tactics (Fleming, Theresa M, et al.). They describe the potential of serious games and gamification as having three sides, the first being “appealing potential,” referring again to how the popularity of gaming could increase the reach of mental health treatments, the second being “engaging potential,” referring to how the often positive and encouraging user experience potential of games could be applied to mental health treatments, and the third being ‘effectiveness potential,” referring to how the use of the game as a medium allows for the employment of both “conventional and non-traditional processes for behavior change and learning” (Fleming, Theresa M, et al.). It is important for me, in working on an app designed to improve the user’s mental health, to consider how and why I want the app to feature gamification, rather than simply following trends set by existing apps, like Superbetter.</p>
<p>In “Mental Health Smartphone Apps: Review and Evidence-Based Recommendations for Future Developments,” the various authors argue that, for the development of more effective apps, a set of “clear, practical, evidence-based recommendations” is necessary (Bakker, David, et al.). They present 16 guidelines to consider when developing mental health apps. They suggest that mental health apps, for example, be “cognitive behavioural therapy based,” be “designed for use by nonclinical populations,” allow for the “reporting of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors,” be designed to “recommend activities,”  feature “simple and intuitive interface and interactions,” and “link to crisis support system services” (Bakker, David, et al.). One thing they note on a number of occasions is the importance of conducting “experimental trials to establish efficacy,” stating that this step is missing from the development of most existing mental health apps (Bakker, David, et al.). The guidelines and suggestions provided by the authors were developed in direct response to what they deemed to be lacking from existing apps. They will certainly be helpful in guiding me on my own development.</p>
