    <h2>topic summary: needs</h2>
    <p>Mental illness and poor mental health have become widespread and serious problems affecting countless individuals on a daily basis. Mental illnesses can rarely if ever be solved with simple, universal solutions, and require consistent, customizable care. Maintenance of care and consistent self-care become difficult in the context of the demanding and uncompromising spheres of industry and education. Mindfulness and treatment aids can serve to remind and assist in the process of self-care and self-maintenance, but, given that these processes are often highly personal and must be tailored to one's specific needs, these aids are not applicable or available to many individuals who might need them. There are countless apps and websites available that claim to exist for the sake of increased mental health. However, most of these services provide simple solutions that require significant free time, energy, and motivation. In short, they provide solutions for financially privileged neurotypical individuals. Neurodiverse individuals need much more customizable services, and services that account for the fatigue that accompanies many mental illnesses. Those in need of mental health services also frequently cannot afford to spend a significant amount of time on self-care, even if they are physically or psychologically able to do so. There is a serious need for digital mental health services that provide customizable services for a wider range of needs, including those of neurodiverse, low-energy, and/or working class individuals.</p>
    <h2>target audience</h2>
    <p>My target audience is college-aged individuals who are mentally ill and seeking easy and potentially fun ways to incorporate their self-care or treatment into their everyday routine, as naturally as they use Instagram and Twitter. They are often busy with their schoolwork and a part-time job, and they struggle to prioritize and practice self-care, or engage with any treatments that might address some of their needs. Although my target audience is relatively limited, I hope to feature customizable measures that would allow a wider range of individuals to access and benefit from self-care and treatment maintenance services.</p>
    <h2>goals (and how)</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of this project is to facilitate customized self-care or treatment that can address a number of potential needs and user goals, based on user input, to allow for the accommodation of more user needs and, hopefully, for the healing, treatment, or care of more individuals. The secondary goal of the project is to serve as a motivational tool for low-energy neurodiverse individuals who may struggle to maintain routine self-care practices due to their fatigue. The project will rely heavily on user input to generate routines, suggestions, and reminders, but will also include a number of pre-programmed tracks that users may experiment with if they are unsure of their preferred set-ups. I have also considered the inclusion of social media functionality to allow for the formation of communities and the sharing of suggestions, advice, empathy, or experiences with others who share their diagnoses, needs, concerns, general location, or other interests or similarities. I am largely limited by time in this pursuit, so there may only be so much customization and so many pre-programmed tracks available come the completion of the project.</p>
    <h2>most important message</h2>
    <p>Treatment and self-care are highly individual. It can be difficult to find the treatment or routine that works for you, and your needs and preferences may change over time, but every individual deserves to take care of themselves and have their needs addressed.</p>
    <h2>ui/ux goals</h2>
    <p>As aforementioned, I hope that the user interaction will be enjoyable, perhaps even game-like, to encourage continued and repeated use. One argument for the inclusion of social media functionality is that most apps and websites with consistently returning users are those that function as social media platforms. Smooth transitions, and potentially animations, would serve to engage the user with the content, and hopefully keep them focused on the app or website during each use. Audio components would function the same way, in addition to setting either a calming or energizing mood. I would like to use either cool colors, illustrations featuring natural motifs, and brush-stroke script typefaces to communicate a calming, serene feeling, or photographs featuring light pink natural landscapes and more rigid typefaces to create a more energizing experience.</p>
