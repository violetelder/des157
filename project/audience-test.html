    <p>Thank you for your help! The website you're about to test out, "LocalCare," is to showcase self-care techniques in Davis, supplied by Davis community members and students.</p>
    <h2>Here's what I'd like you to do!</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to the website by clicking <a href="audience-test/index.html" target=“_blank”>this link!</a></li>
      <li>Explore the map! check out a few community-supplied self-care tips on the map!</li>
      <li>Close, open, and then close (again) the info/welcome box!</li>
      <li>Check out the additional community comments and tips!</li>
      <li>Add your own tip! (share as much or as little as you want, and feel free to use a fake name)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There's no wrong way to navigate the website! If you have trouble doing the things listed above, that's not a bad thing - it will help me make the website more clear for future visitors! :)</p>
    <h2>Here are the kinds of things I'll ask you about after the testing is done!</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Were any of the tips helpful to you? (No need to tell me which ones if you don't want to!)</li>
      <li>Is there anything I could do to make the website more helpful to you?</li>
      <li>Do you think you would use, benefit, or return multiple times to a Davis-specific site like this?</li>
      <li>Would you prefer to see different kinds of tips on there?</li>
      <li>Could you read everything?</li>
      <li>Was it clear how the website worked?</li>
    </ol>
