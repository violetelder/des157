    <h3>what did i learn?</h3>
    <p>One of the most valuable things I learned from my target audience testers was that they were more interested in the tips on the map than they were in the other tips. They made some aesthetic suggestions, letting me know to make a clearer hierarchy, navigation, spruce up the pop-ups some, and change the way the mouse appears when hovering over a pop-up, but the input on the functionality of the site was very valuable. One tester noted that they felt I needed to reconcile the two parts of the site that didn't seem to be working together: the additional tips and the map.</p>
    <p>One of the testers suggested that a vetting process to present a curated list of tips might be helpful. While I had originally wanted to make the "tip map" very open to all, I do see their points about the potential value of a vetting system. That same tested noted that, if I can't get the database operational, maybe I should set it up so that, when someone chooses to share a tip, their input gets emailed to me (and, they said, I should make that clear in the submission box: "Share your tips and we'll review and post them later!").</p>
    <p>Another very valuable suggestion made was the addition of checkboxes to filter out different activities, if it is a curated list of tips (and the use of different icons, or color-coded icons, for different activities).</p>
    <h3>where do we go from here?</h3>
    <p>For the final iteration of the project, I intend to look at it more as a curated list. I will allow visitors to email me suggestions, their own tips, for addition to the list. The final iteration will also no longer include the additional tips, but rather be entirely focused on the map, with the suggested checkboxes. I will come up with a few popular categories, and I will collect more tips. I can also reconnect to something I was really interested in earlier on in this project: customization and different needs/contexts for self-care! I will be adding in some separate filtering options for different energy levels, and I'll rate the tips I have collected so far based on the energy needed for each, an addition I'm really excited about because of how it relates to earlier visions of this project! Given that my testers were clearly more engaged by the map than the list/timeline, I think focusing on the map will make visiting the site a better and more enjoyable experience for them!</p>
